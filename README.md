## Problem Statement
To build a CNN based model which can accurately detect melanoma. Melanoma is a type of cancer that can be deadly if not detected early. It accounts for 75% of skin cancer deaths. A solution which can evaluate images and alert the dermatologists about the presence of melanoma has the potential to reduce a lot of manual effort needed in diagnosis.

The dataset from Internation Skin Imaging Collaboration (ISIC) contains of 2357 images of maliagnment and benign oncology diseases. All images are sorted according to the classification with ISIC.


The data set contains of the following diseases

       Actinic keratosis
       Basal cell carcinoma
       Dermatofibroma
       Melanom
       Nevus
       Pigmented benign keratosis
       Seborrheic keratosis
       Squamous cell carcinoma
       Vascular lesion


## Methods Used

Main aim of this will be to classify the images accuractly. Following steps will be taken to achieve that

    1.Examine and understand data
    2. Build an input pipeline
    3. Build the model
    4. Train the model
    5. Test the model 
    6. Improve the model
